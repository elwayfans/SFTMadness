The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is led by a living prophet, supported by twelve Apostles and other leaders patterned after Christ’s ancient Church. For more information about what we believe, click here . Faith & Education From its earliest days, Brigham Young University has been a place where academics and faith go hand in hand with the ultimate goal of helping students develop their full divine potential as children of God. “I want you to remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God,” instructed Church president Brigham Young in 1876. Church president Russell M. Nelson has recently taught: “In the Church, obtaining an education and getting knowledge are a religious responsibility. We educate our minds so that one day we can render service of worth to somebody else.” At BYU, learning is not an end unto itself but a means to bless God’s children. This charge is exemplified in BYU’s motto, “Enter to learn; go forth to serve.” Go Forth to Serve As part of BYU’s graduation requirements, undergraduate complete religious education courses. Additionally, students and faculty are encouraged to find and make connections to eternal truths within their chosen field of study. BYU students gather in the Marriott Center for a Tuesday devotional. Photo by BYU Photo While many colleges and universities house a chapel on campus, the entirety of BYU’s campus has been dedicated for worship. Each Sunday, classrooms, study areas, and meeting spaces become places for students to gather to pray, sing, partake of the sacrament, and study the gospel of Jesus Christ together. Furthermore, on Tuesdays the entire campus community comes together for a weekly devotional––an inspiring and gospel-centered message prepared by BYU faculty and staff and Church leaders.
